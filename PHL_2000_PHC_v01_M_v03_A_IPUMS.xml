Documentation of census data and harmonized variables as found in IPUMS-International. The International Household Survey Network (IHSN) contracted IPUMS International for generating DDI and Dublin Core-compliant metadata related to population and housing census datasets from developing countries. The objective was to provide countries with detailed metadata in a format compatible with the DDI standard used by most of these countries, with a view to guarantee the preservation of the data and metadata, and the publishing of metadata.

The intellectual rights (including copyright) for the data and metadata in IPUMS are retained by the countries under a Memorandum of Understanding with the contributing countries. IPUMS-International has distribution rights to the metadata and data. The XML documents generated by this process are viewed as a distribution of the metadata.
        
Fields edited by the World Bank are: DDI ID and study ID to match World Bank study naming convention, as well as DDI Document Version and Version Description to reflect changes included in version 6.4.

          <![CDATA[Version 6.4. The datasets contain selected variables from the original census microdata plus harmonized variables from the IPUMS-International database.

In v6.4, the research team continued to carry out improvements to geography, providing harmonized geographic units for the second administrative level for roughly half the countries. More information about IPUMS geography variables is available <a href='https://international.ipums.org/international/geography_variables.shtml'>here</a>. Also, approximately 100 integrated variables were renamed. Affected variables with their current and previous names are listed <a href='https://international.ipums.org/international/resources/misc_docs/renamed_variables_sept2015.pdf'>here</a>. Geography variable also underwent wholesale renaming.

In this update, IPUMS added 19 new samples for Armenia, Austria, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, France, Ghana, Mozambique, Paraguay, Portugal, Puerto Rico, South Africa, and Spain. Ethiopia, Mozambique, and Paraguay were newly added countries to IPUMS. Samples for other countries extend pre-existing series for those countries.]]>

        <![CDATA[IPUMS-International is an effort to inventory, preserve, harmonize, and disseminate census microdata from around the world. The project has collected the world's largest archive of publicly available census samples. The data are coded and documented consistently across countries and over time to facillitate comparative research. IPUMS-International makes these data available to qualified researchers free of charge through a web dissemination system.

The IPUMS project is a collaboration of the Minnesota Population Center, National Statistical Offices, and international data archives. Major funding is provided by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the Demographic and Behavioral Sciences Branch of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Additional support is provided by the University of Minnesota Office of the Vice President for Research, the Minnesota Population Center, and Sun Microsystems.]]>

UNIT DESCRIPTIONS:
- Dwellings: A housing unit is a structurally separate and independent place of abode which, by the way it has been constructed, converted or arranged is intended for habitation by one or more households. Structures or parts of structures not intended for habitation such as commercial, industrial, and agricultural buildings, or natural and man-made shelters such as caves, boats, abandoned trucks, culverts, etc., but used as living quarters by households are also considered as housing units.
- Households: A household is a social unit consisting of a person living alone or a group of persons who (1) sleep in the same housing unit and (2) have a common arrangement for the preparation  and
consumption of food.
- Group quarters: Institutional population comprises persons who are found living in institutional living quarters. They may have their own families or households elsewhere but at the time of the census they are committed or confined in institutions, or they live in institutional living quarters and are usually subject to a common authority or management, or are bound by either a common public objective or a common personal interest.]]>

Before data may be distributed to an individual researcher, an electronic license agreement must be signed and approved.

To gain access to the data, a researcher must agree to the following:

(1) Implement security measures to prevent unauthorized access to census microdata. Under IPUMS-International agreements with collaborating agencies, redistribution of the data to third parties is prohibited.

(2) Use the microdata for the exclusive purposes of scholarly research and education. Researchers must explicitly agree to not use microdata acquired for any commercial or income-generating venture.

(3) Maintain the confidentiality of persons, households, and other entities. Any attempt to ascertain the identity of persons or households from the microdata is prohibited. Alleging that a person or household has been identified is also prohibited.

(4) Report all publications based on these data to IPUMS-International, which will in turn pass the information on to the relevant national statistical agencies.

Once a project is approved, a password is issued and data may be acquired through the Internet. Penalties for violating the license include: revocation of the license, recall of all microdata acquired, filing of a motion of censure to the appropriate professional organizations, and civil prosecution under the relevant national or international statutes.

These safeguards mirror the principles from the Joint ECE/Eurostat Work Session on Statistical Data Confidentiality. Employees of the Minnesota Population Center who work with the census microdata to produce the harmonized database also sign agreements to respect the confidentiality of the data.

IPUMS-International works with each country's statistical office to minimize the risk of disclosure of respondent information. The details of the confidentiality protections vary across countries, but in all cases, names and detailed geographic information are suppressed and top-codes are imposed on variables such as income that might identify specific persons. In addition, IPUMS-International uses a variety of technical procedures to enhance confidentiality protection. These include the following:

(1) Swapping an undisclosed fraction of records from one administrative district to another to make positive identification of individuals impossible.

(2) Randomizing the placement of households within districts to disguise the order in which individuals were enumerated or the data processed.

(3) Aggregating codes of sensitive characteristics (e.g., grouping together very small ethnic categories)

(4) Top- and bottom-coding continuous variables to prevent identification of extreme cases.

The safety record for public-use census microdata is apparently perfect. In almost four decades of use, there has not been a single verified breach of statistical confidentiality. The measures implemented by the IPUMS-International are designed to extend this record.]]>

        <![CDATA[SAMPLE identifies the IPUMS sample from which the case is drawn.  Each sample receives a unique 9-digit code.  The code is structured as follows:


The first 3 digits are the ISO/UN codes used in COUNTRY



The next 4 digits are the year of the census/survey



The final 2 digits identify the sample within the year.  For the last two digits, censuses or large census-like surveys have a value "0" (e.g, 01) in the second-to-last digit, household surveys have a value of "2" (e.g., 21), and employment surveys have a value of "4" (e.g., 41).]]>

        <![CDATA[SERIAL is an identifying number unique to each household in a given sample. All person records are assigned the same serial number as the household record that they follow. (Person records also have their own unique identifiers -- see PERNUM.) The combination of SAMPLE and SERIAL provides a unique identifier for every household in the IPUMS-International database; SAMPLE, SERIAL and PERNUM uniquely identify every person in the database. 

SERIAL can be used to identify dwellings in some samples.  In these samples, the first 7 digits of SERIAL provide the dwelling number common to all households that were sampled from the same structure.  The last three digits give the sequence of the household within the dwelling.  The following is a list of samples in which dwellings can be inferred:

Venezuela 1990, 2001
Vietnam 1989  


In all other samples, the last 3 digits are always zeroes.

SERIAL was constructed for IPUMS-International, and has no relation to the serial number in the original datasets.]]>

        PERSONS indicates how many person records are included in the household (i.e., the number of person records associated with the household record in the sample). These person records will all have the same serial number (SERIAL) as the household record. The information contained in the household record will normally apply to all of these persons.

        SUBSAMP allocates each case to one of 100 subsample replicates, randomly numbered from 0 to 99. Each subsample is nationally representative and preserves any stratification of the sample from which it is drawn. Users who need a representative subset of a sample can use SUBSAMP to select their cases. For example, to randomly extract 10% of the cases from a sample, select any 10 of the 100 subsamples.

        <![CDATA[GQ identifies households as vacant dwellings, group quarters, or private households. Group quarters -- collective dwellings -- are generally institutions and other group living arrangements such as rooming houses and boarding schools.

Institutions often retain persons under formal supervision or custody, such as correctional institutions, military barracks, asylums, or nursing homes. Educational and religious group dwellings (e.g., boarding schools, convents, monasteries, etc.) are also included in the institutional classification. 

Group quarter designations are often useful for understanding the universe of households that answered questions about household characteristics. Censuses will often exclude group quarters from such questions.]]>

        <![CDATA[NFAMS is a constructed variable that indicates the number of families within each household. A "family" is any group of persons related by blood, adoption, or marriage. An unrelated individual within the household is considered a separate family. Thus, a household consisting of a widow and her servant contains two families; a household consisting of a large, multiple-generation extended family with no lodgers or servants would count as a single family.  

NFAMS is constructed from information in RELATE (relationship to head) and from the constructed pointer variables SPLOC, MOMLOC, and POPLOC (location of spouse, mother, and father).  See those variable descriptions for more detail.]]>

B1 Type of building/house

The distribution of households by type of building supplies information about the available housing accommodation at the time of the census, patterns of living, and building trends. Such details are essential for planning future housing needs. For housing programmes, information is required on the number of households that need to be provided with housing. The number of households living in marginal housing units (commercial/industrial/agricultural buildings used as living quarters such as barns, warehouses, mills, offices, etc., and other housing units such as boats, caves, etc.) provides a first approximation of this element of housing needs.

Cross out the circle the applicable type of building occupied by the household. The types of building are as follows:

[] 1 Single House - This is an independent structure intended for one household separated by open space or walls from all other structures. It includes the so-called "nipa hut" or a small house that is built as a more or less permanent housing unit or a "barong-barong" made of salvaged/makeshift/improvised materials.

[] 2 Duplex - This is a structure intended for two households, with complete living facilities for each. It is divided vertically or horizontally into two separate housing units which are usually identical.

[] 3 Multi-Unit Residential (3 or more units) - This is a building intended for residential use only, consisting of 3 or more housing units. These houses may consist of one or more stories in a row of three or more housing units, separated from each other by walls extending from the ground to the roof or a building having floors to accommodate three or more housing units.

Example:

a. Apartment building - a structure usually of several stories, made up of three or more independent entrances from internal halls or courts. An apartment has one common entrance from the outside.

b. Accesoria - a one or two-floor structure divided into three or more housing units, each housing unit having its own separate entrance from the outside. Another name for accesoria is row house.

c. Residential condominium - a high-rise building where the housing units are owned individually but the land and other areas and facilities are owned in common.

Note: A building that was originally constructed as a single house or duplex, but now partitioned into three or more rooms/groups of rooms (with separate entrance from a common hall or passage) without changing the outside structure or appearance, will be classified as a single house or a duplex, as the case may be.

[] 4 Commercial/Industrial/Agricultural - These buildings are not intended mainly for human habitation but used as living quarters of households at the time of the census.
A commercial building is a building built for transacting business or for rendering professional services, such as a store, office, warehouse, rice mill, etc.

An industrial building is a building built for processing, assembling, fabricating, finishing, manufacturing or packaging operations, such as a factory or a plant.
An agricultural building is any structure built for agricultural purposes, such as a barn, stable, poultry house, granary, etc.

[] 5 Institutional Living Quarters - Hotels, motels, inns, boarding houses, dormitories, pensions and lodging houses fall within this category. This group comprises permanent structures which provide lodging and/or meals on fee basis. Institutional buildings are buildings intended for persons confined to receive medical, charitable or other care/treatment such as hospital and orphanages, for persons detained such as jails and penal colonies, and other buildings like convents, school dormitories, etc.

Also included in this category are camps which are defined sets of premises originally intended for the temporary accommodation of persons with common activities or interests like military camps, and other camps established for the housing of workers in mining, agriculture, public works or other types or enterprises.

[] 6. Other Housing Units - This refers to living quarters which are not intended for human habitation nor located in permanent buildings but which are nevertheless, used as living quarters at the time of the census. Caves, old railroad cars, other natural shelters and mobile housing units such as trailer, barge, cart, boat, etc., fall within this category.	

Note: When a building is intended partly for residential purposes and partly for commercial or industrial purposes, report as residential (code 1, 2 or 3) if half or more of the building is residential. Thus, if the second floor of a two-storey building is for housing, the building should be classified as residential. Likewise, if a one- storey building is divided into several units, and the front part of each unit is for business purposes and the back part is for living quarters, also report the building as residential.]]>

B2 Construction material of the roof

The construction material of the roof and wall provides information of the construction, replacement and improvement of housing units.

This indicator provides data in evaluating construction statistics, programme implementation, and for estimating the investment, past and future, in housing construction. It also determines how many of the households are housed in structurally acceptable housing units. Structural acceptability of housing units implies that these are made of durable construction materials that will safeguard the household occupants from adverse climatic effects and provide protection and privacy.

Cross out the circle opposite the kind of material used in the construction of the roof. This item can be answered through observation but if you are in doubt, ask the respondent.

The kinds of construction materials of the roof are as follows:


[] 1 Galvanized Iron/aluminum
[] 2 Tile/concrete/clay tile
[] 3 Half galvanized iron and half concrete
[] 4 Wood
[] 5 Cogon/nipa/anahaw
[] 6 Asbestos
[] 7 Makeshift/salvaged/improvised materials
[] 8 Others, specify	


If two or more kinds of materials are used, report the material most used. Thus, for a house with different kinds of roofs, report the material used in the main portion (usually containing the living room/sala and bedrooms). Specify the kind of construction material used for the roof if it is not one of the categories mentioned above it.
Bamboo when used as roofing is included in category of Wood.

Housing units in structures such as culverts, bridges, etc. should have a marked circle opposite Makeshift/salvaged/improvised materials.]]>

B4 State of repair

This provides information on the current status of the building which is of special significance to housing programmes. It is also useful for housing priorities and for the identification of groups in need of housing repair.
 
Determine   the   current   state   of   repair   of   the building/house   and   cross   out   the   circle   opposite the appropriate selection.

1 Needs no repair/needs minor repair - This building is usually new or has a good building maintenance, i.e., no deterioration is apparent from the outside.

2 Needs major repair - The building cannot fully protect the occupants from the elements (rain, wind, temperature). It may have cracks in the interior walls, leaking roof, holes on the floors, broken windows, etc. which can only be mended by major repair.

3 Dilapidated/condemned - This building is beyond repair. Dilapidated parts are found in pillars, roofs and outer walls needing renovation. Condemned buildings, wherein substandard materials/procedures were used in the construction or which are structurally defective, are also included here.

4 Under renovation/being repaired - This is a building that was fully constructed and finished but is now being repaired for some deterioration or damages. This also includes buildings being renovated to make additional structures or to modify/repair existing structures.

5 Under construction - The construction work has started but not yet completed and the construction is still going on.
Construction means all on-site work done from site preparation, excavation, foundation, and assembly of all components and installation of utilities and equipment of buildings/structures.

6 Unfinished construction - This is a partly constructed building but at the time of visit, construction is temporarily or permanently stopped, that is, no construction activity is going on for quite some time.]]>

B5 Year building/house was built

This provides the basis for appraising the building/house inventory in terms of durability, the expected rate of replacement, and the estimate of the annual rate of building/house construction during the inter-censal period or the preceding 10 years. It also provides the estimate for maintenance costs and an insight into the housing patterns of the population.

The year the building was built refers to the year when the construction was completed and when ready for occupancy and not when construction began. Generally, building construction commenced and finished within the same year, although there are cases when the period of construction extends to several years. Report the year when the building was finished.

If the building is being constructed and vacant, mark the circle opposite the category Not applicable to signify that the question is not applicable to the building. If the building is being constructed but already occupied, enter the year when it was occupied.

Cross out the circle opposite the appropriate selection.

D1 Floor area of the housing unit

Density of occupancy in terms of floor area per person is a measure of the adequacy of housing. In line with the aim of housing policy to provide adequate housing space to a level consistent with the maintenance of health of the occupants, it is important in planning to adopt housing standards.

The data on floor area will provide planners information on the current status of the density of occupancy of existing housing units in the country.

Cross out the circle of the selection made.

[Table omitted].

Floor area refers to the space enclosed by the exterior wall of the housing unit. In case of several floors, get the area of each floor in square meters or square feet and add together to get the total floor area of the housing unit.

There are many ways in approximating the total floor area. You may use any method which is more convenient to you. You may use a meter stick, visual approximation (using your eyes only) or your pace factor (see Appendix 4). In case the respondent does not know the floor area of the housing unit, you can approximate the floor area using any of the above mentioned methods. Familiarize yourself with the length of a meter so that you can do visual approximation.

An example of getting the estimate of floor area is shown in Illustration 7.3. In this illustration, it is assumed that the width and length of the floor spaces are already determined using one of the methods discussed above.

To get the estimated floor area (EFA) of the around floor, use the following formula:


EFA ground floor = 10 meters x 7 meters = 70 sq. m.


Using the same procedure for the second floor,


EFA second floor =10 meters x 9 meters = 90 SQ. m.


To get the total estimated floor area of the housing unit, which will be the answer to the inquiry "What is the estimated floor area of this housing unit?"


EFA ground floor + EFA second floor =70 + 90= 160 sq.m.


For this example, mark the circle opposite the range of values that includes the given answer, in this case, of category 150-199.]]>

H1 Fuel for lighting

The proportion of households with access to electricity can provide planners useful indication of areas where community lighting needs to be extended. Data on types of fuel can be analyzed to     forecast future demands for various sources of energy and hence plan for power installations.
Cross out the circle opposite the category which corresponds to the fuel used by the household for its lighting facility. If the household is using electricity, mark the circle for this item even if it is not used most of the time. If two or more types of lighting are used, except electricity, e.g., kerosene and oil, oil and candles, etc., report the type of lighting which is used most of the time. 

Cross out the circle, therefore, of the category corresponding to the type of lighting used more often than the other. The types of fuel for lighting and their codes are as follows:


[] 1 Electricity
[] 2 Kerosene (gas)
[] 3 Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)
[] 4 Oil (vegetable, animal, etc.)
[] 5 Others, specify	


If the household uses a generator, report the fuel being used to run the generator.

Refer to Illustration 8.4 for the different types of fuel for lighting.



H2 Fuel for cooking

The information on fuel for cooking is relevant in assessing energy planning decisions, energy conservation programs and in developing marketing strategies. It also serves as a benchmark for the study of changes in household energy used and user patterns over time. It is also useful in monitoring supply and demand requirements for alternative fuels.

The question in H2 asks for the kind of fuel the household users most of the time for cooking. Mark the corresponding circle for the appropriate item. If two or more kinds of cooking fuel are used, e.g., electricity and LPG; LPG and wood; kerosene and charcoal; etc., report the fuel which is used most of the time for cooking.

H3, H4   Source of water supply for drinking and/or cooking, for laundry and/or bathing

The information on main source of drinking water provides the number of households with ready access to a potable water supply, as well as the availability of piped water for each housing unit. The provision of a piped water installation for every housing unit should be one of the primary objectives of housing policy as well as of public health policy.

Determine from the respondent the household's main source of water for drinking and/or cooking 
(H3) and for laundry and/or bathing (H4). Enter the appropriate code in the box provided. If there are two or more sources of water for drinking, report the source used most of the time during the past twelve months.

The different sources of drinking water and their codes are as follows:

[] 01 Own use, faucet, community water system - The household gets its water supply from a faucet inside the house/yard directly connected to a water pipeline from the community water system such as the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) or the local water network system.

The method on how they purify the water or the real source of water is irrelevant. Thus, for water systems which have deep well as their source of water, report under this category as long as they subscribe to community water system.

[] 02 Shared, faucet, community water system - The household gets its water supply from the faucet of another household, establishment, or office, which is connected to the community water system.

[] 03 Own use, tubed/piped deep well - Water is taken from a tubed/piped well which is at least 100 feet (5 ximkm{(on(:8(neet pipes or 30 meters deep) and for private use of the household or households in the same building or compound.

[] 04 Shared, tubed/piped deep well - Water is taken from a deep well, which is at least 100 ft. or 30 meters deep of another household, establishment, or office or from a deep well which was constructed for public use.

[] 05 Tubed/piped shallow well - Water is taken from a tubed/piped well which is less than 100 feet deep.

[] 06 Dug Well - The household gets its water supply from a well, which may be provided with a protective device against contamination or pollution. A shallow well (dug and with water depository) which is provided with a pump and cover and is free from seepage from the side, and an ordinary dug well ("balon") also belong to this type.

[] 07 Spring, lake, river, rain, etc. - The household gets its water supply from natural bodies of water, or water is accumulated from rainfall.

[] 08 Peddler - Included in this item are water bought in tanks, drums, pails, etc. (peddler). These are the usual sources of water supply of households in low water pressure areas with no community water system.

[] 09 Bottled Water - Mineral/distilled water bought in bottles, or gallons are under this category.

[] 10 Others, Specify - Includes other sources not mentioned in categories 1 to 9 above.

H3, H4   Source of water supply for drinking and/or cooking, for laundry and/or bathing

The information on main source of drinking water provides the number of households with ready access to a potable water supply, as well as the availability of piped water for each housing unit. The provision of a piped water installation for every housing unit should be one of the primary objectives of housing policy as well as of public health policy.

Determine from the respondent the household's main source of water for drinking and/or cooking 
(H3) and for laundry and/or bathing (H4). Enter the appropriate code in the box provided. If there are two or more sources of water for drinking, report the source used most of the time during the past twelve months.

The different sources of drinking water and their codes are as follows:

[] 01 Own use, faucet, community water system - The household gets its water supply from a faucet inside the house/yard directly connected to a water pipeline from the community water system such as the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) or the local water network system.

The method on how they purify the water or the real source of water is irrelevant. Thus, for water systems which have deep well as their source of water, report under this category as long as they subscribe to community water system.

[] 02 Shared, faucet, community water system - The household gets its water supply from the faucet of another household, establishment, or office, which is connected to the community water system.

[] 03 Own use, tubed/piped deep well - Water is taken from a tubed/piped well which is at least 100 feet (5 ximkm{(on(:8(neet pipes or 30 meters deep) and for private use of the household or households in the same building or compound.

[] 04 Shared, tubed/piped deep well - Water is taken from a deep well, which is at least 100 ft. or 30 meters deep of another household, establishment, or office or from a deep well which was constructed for public use.

[] 05 Tubed/piped shallow well - Water is taken from a tubed/piped well which is less than 100 feet deep.

[] 06 Dug Well - The household gets its water supply from a well, which may be provided with a protective device against contamination or pollution. A shallow well (dug and with water depository) which is provided with a pump and cover and is free from seepage from the side, and an ordinary dug well ("balon") also belong to this type.

[] 07 Spring, lake, river, rain, etc. - The household gets its water supply from natural bodies of water, or water is accumulated from rainfall.

[] 08 Peddler - Included in this item are water bought in tanks, drums, pails, etc. (peddler). These are the usual sources of water supply of households in low water pressure areas with no community water system.

[] 09 Bottled Water - Mineral/distilled water bought in bottles, or gallons are under this category.

[] 10 Others, Specify - Includes other sources not mentioned in categories 1 to 9 above.
Refer to Illustration 8.6 for the different sources of water supply.]]>

H5 Tenure status of the housing unit

The extent to which households own or rent the living quarters which they occupy is of special significance to housing programmes. Data on tenure status is also useful for housing priorities and policies, in promotion of house ownership and identification of groups in need of housing assistance.

Housing unit. A structurally separate and independent place of abode which, by the way it has been constructed, converted, or arranged is intended for habitation by one household.
Ask the respondent the question, "Do you own or amortize this housing unit occupied by your household or do you rent, rent-free with consent of owner, or rent-free without consent of owner?"

Cross out the circle corresponding to the tenure status of the housing unit by the household.

The tenure status of the housing unit and their corresponding codes are as follows:

[] 1 Owned/being amortized - if the household is the owner and has legal possession of the housing unit or the household claims to own it. Included also are those housing units which are being amortized or paid on installment basis.

[] 2 Rented - if the occupant actually pays rent either in cash or in kind.

[] 3 Rent-free with consent of owner - if the household occupies the housing unit with the permission of the owner and without paying any rent in cash or in kind to the owner. Included here are the households of farm tenants/lessees who occupy rent-free houses belonging to the owner of the lands they farm; also those employees given free housing as part of fringe benefits (they are made to vacate the housing unit upon separation from work.)

[] 4 Rent-free without consent of owner - if the household occupies the housing unit without the consent or knowledge of the owner. Examples are squatters who are occupying public and private buildings.

Specifically:

1. if the crossed out answer in H5 is Rented, skip to H9.
2. if the crossed out answer in H5 is Rent-free w/ consent of owner or Rent-free w/o consent of owner, skip to H10]]>

H9 Monthly rental of housing unit or lot

The information on monthly rental of housing unit or lot is used in reviews of government housing policy, and in considering matters such as the need for rent controls. It enables analysis of income level to rental level for particular groups.

Ask the question in H9, "How much is the monthly rental?" only if entry in H5 or H8 is "Rented".

The total monthly rental of the housing unit should exclude rental for furnishings and payment for electricity and water. Rental for the housing unit, which includes furnishings, or payment for electricity and water, can be estimated by subtracting the estimated rental for furnishings or amount for the consumption of water and electricity from the total monthly rental.

Report the monthly rental even if the rent is still unpaid or paid by someone who is not a household member.

Cross out the circle corresponding to the range of cost of monthly rental of housing unit or lot.

H10 Usual manner of garbage disposal

The proportion of households with access to sanitary manner of garbage disposal provides knowledge of the environmental living conditions and is therefore essential for health planners in the formulation of plans and programs to improve general health conditions.

Inquire from the respondent the manner by which the household disposes its kitchen garbage such as leftover food, peelings of fruits and vegetables, fish and chicken entrails, etc. If the household has various ways of disposing its kitchen garbage, ask for the manner used most of the time.

Described below are some of the more common methods of disposal used in the country. 

Determine which of these methods best describes the practice of the household. Cross out the circle of one of the selections below.

1 Picked-up by service garbage truck - when the local government or a private contractor manages the systematic collection of garbage in the community through the use of garbage trucks/carts.

2 Dumping in individual pit (not burned) - when garbage is simply thrown in pits whether inside the yard or vacant lots and left to decay.

3 Burning - when the household dumps its garbage in an open space or pit and burns it.

4 Composting - when garbage is composted, that is, allowed to decay under controlled conditions and the composted materials are collected later for use as soil conditioner or fertilizer.

5 Burying - when the garbage is thrown in pit and then covered with soil.

6 Feeding to animals - when the garbage is given to animals as feed.

7 Others, specify - if the household you are interviewing disposes its kitchen garbage in a manner different from those]]>

H11 Kind of toilet facility

The data on kind of toilet facility provide the minimum data required for the evaluation of facilities available to the housing units. Like safe drinking water source, a sanitary toilet facility is a measure to prevent diseases and improve the health condition of household members. This indicator likewise determines the sanitation status of households.

Cross out the circle corresponding to the type of toilet facility used by the household.

The different types of toilet facilities commonly used in buildings and houses throughout the country are:

[] 1 Water-sealed, sewer/septic tank, used exclusively by the household

[] 2 Water-sealed, sewer/septic tank, shared with other households

[] 3 Water-sealed, other depository, used exclusively by the household

[] 4 Water-sealed, other depository, shared with other households

Water sealed - as the name implies, is the type of toilet where after water is flushed or poured into the bowl, a small amount of water is left in the bowl and seals the bottom of the bowl from the pipe leading to the depository.

Sewer/septic tank - a tank in which the solid matter or sewage is accumulated to be disintegrated by bacteria. This is commonly called "Poso Negro".

Other Depository - if the depository is other than a sewer/septic tank.

[] 5 Closed Pit - it is a type of toilet without a water-sealed bowl and the depository is constructed usually of large circular tubes made of concrete or clay covered on top and has a small opening. It may or may not have a box for sitting or squatting over the opening; e.g., antipolo, etc.

[] 6 Open pit - it is the same as closed pit but without covering.

[] 7 Other (pail system, etc.) - classify here a toilet wherein fecal matter is accumulated in a pail to be picked up for disposal from time to time or any kind of toilet facility not belonging to the preceding types.

[] 8 None - for households using no toilet facility.

Refer to Illustration 8.7 for the different types of toilet facilities.

H14 Language/Dialect generally spoken

Language/dialect generally spoken at home provides a measure of the linguistic homogeneity or difference in the population. It can also be used to measure the extent of actual use of the language/dialect within a household.

Ask the question in H14, "What is the language/dialect generally spoken at home by members of this household?"

The languages/dialects and their corresponding codes can be found in the Code Book.
If two or more languages/dialects are spoken in the household, enter the code for the language/dialect which is commonly spoken by majority of the household members.

Note that "Visaya" is not a dialect. Inquire if it is Hiligaynon (llonggo), Cebuano, Waray, etc.,]]>

        This variable is the strata identifier for the sample. Strata is a constructed variable that captures implicit geographic stratification resulting from the sample design. It is created by assigning a unique identifier to groups of between 10 and 19 adjacent households. Additional documentation is available on the Variance Estimation page.

For the samples that are truly weighted (see the comparability discussion), HHWT must be used to yield accurate household-level statistics.

NOTE: HHWT has 2 implied decimal places.  That is, the last two digits of the eight-digit variable are decimal digits, but there is no actual decimal in the data.]]>

GEO1_PH is spatially harmonized to account for political boundary changes across census years. Some detail is lost in harmonization; see the comparability discussion. A GIS map (in shapefile format), corresponding to GEO1_PH can be downloaded from the GIS Boundary files page in the IPUMS International web site.

The full set of geography variables for the Philippines can be found in the IPUMS International Geography variables list. For cross-national geographic analysis on the first and second major administrative level refer to GEOLEV1, and GEOLEV2. More information on IPUMS-International geography can be found here.

        OWNERSHIP indicates whether a member of the household owned the housing unit. Households that acquired their unit with a mortgage or other lending arrangement were understood to "own" their unit even if they had not yet completed repayment. For those that did not own their housing unit, several options were possible: renting (from various types of owners), subletting, usufruct, and de facto occupation.

        <![CDATA[MOMLOC is a constructed variable that indicates whether or not the person's mother lived in the same household and, if so, gives the person number of the mother (see PERNUM).  MOMLOC makes it easy for researchers to link the characteristics of children and their (probable) mothers.  

The method by which probable child-mother links are identified is described in PARRULE.

The general design of MOMLOC and other constructed variables follows the methods developed for IPUMS-USA "Family Interrelationships," but the details vary significantly.

Note: MOMLOC identifies social relationships (such as stepmother and adopted mother) as well as biological relationships. The variable STEPMOM is designed to identify some of these social relationships.]]>

The method by which probable child-father links are identified is described in PARRULE.

The general design of POPLOC and other constructed variables follows the methods developed for IPUMS-USA "Family Interrelationships," but the details vary significantly.

Note: POPLOC identifies social relationships (such as stepfather and adopted father) as well as biological relationships. The variable STEPPOP is designed to identify some of these social relationships.]]>

        <![CDATA[PARRULE describes the criteria by which the IPUMS-International variables MOMLOC and POPLOC linked the person to a probable mother and/or father. 

IPUMS-International establishes child-parent links according to five basic rules, and PARRULE gives the number of the rule that applied to the link in question. A link to any parent automatically generates a second link to that parent's spouse or partner, so only one rule is needed to describe both MOMLOC and POPLOC.

Non-zero values of STEPMOM explain why it is probable that the person's mother was a step- or adopted mother. A value of 0 indicates no likely stepmother because (1) the mother identified in MOMLOC was probably the biological mother or (2) there is no mother of this person present in the household.
 
The codes for STEPMOM are as follows:

0 = Biological mother or no mother of this person present in household.  
1 = Mother has no children borne or surviving.
2 = Child reports mother is deceased.
3 = Explicitly identified relationship (stepchild, adopted child, child of unmarried partner, stepchild/child-in-law). 
4 = Mother reports no children in the home.
5 = Age difference between mother and child was less than 12 or greater than 54 years.
6 = Child exceeds known fertility of mother.

See PARRULE for a description of the linking process.

        <![CDATA[FAMSIZE counts the number of the person's own family members living in the household with her/him, including the person her/himself.  These include all persons related to the person by blood, adoption, or marriage as indicated by the census forms or inferred from them.

FAMSIZE is calculated from the units identified in the IPUMS constructed variable FAMUNIT (family unit membebership).  The primary family is defined as all persons related to the head in the RELATE variable. Secondary families are individuals or groups of persons linked together by the IPUMS constructed pointer variables SPLOC, MOMLOC, and POPLOC (location of spouse, mother, and father).]]>

P5 Birth registration with Local Civil Registrar (LCR)

Provisions of civil code and other laws in the country are concerned with the legal or civil rights of an individual. Civil rights could be granted only by the government and proof of one's claim to such rights is dependent on official registration, the legal purpose for which civil registration was designed. The birth of a person is one of the vital events for official registration. The recording of the occurrence of birth in the birth register is called birth registration. And the proof of such registration is the birth certificate with an LCR number.

After recording the date of birth of a person, ask the respondent "Was __________'s birth registered with the LCR?"  Draw an "x" mark on the appropriate circle. When the birth of a member of the household is unknown to the respondent, verify from the member himself. If after probing the birth registration is still unknown, draw an "x" mark on the circle provided for the answer of don't know.]]>

P6 Age as of last birthday

Age, sex and marital status are essential for inclusion in a census for the purposes of analyzing factors of population changes and preparing population estimates and forecasts. Information on these topics is also needed for actuarial analysis of probability of survival and other related life-table functions.

For purposes of the census, age as of last birthday refers to the interval of time between the date of birth and before May 1, 2000, expressed in completed year. Thus, ages are recorded as whole numbers, counting the whole years completed on or prior to May 1, 2000.

Determine the age of each household member by asking the respondent "What is ______'s age as of his/her last birthday?" Always ask the age of the person even if the date of birth is already given. Do not compute for the person's age from the reported date of birth. Enter the age on the space provided.

Here are some basic guidelines for your reference:

1. If during your visit, a member of the household has just celebrated his last birthday on or after May 1, 2000, then you have to report his/her age in his previous birthday. For example, a person has just celebrated his 24th birthday on May 2, 2000, the age to be reported for this person should be 23 and not 24.

2. Enter the age of every person one-year-old and over in completed years.
However, for persons less than 1 year old, enter 00. Entries on age should consist of two digits. For ages 1 to 9, prefix zero (0). For example, 02, 07, etc.

3. For persons born before 1900 (aged 100 and over), code the age as follows:
 
[Table is omitted]

4. Note that the examples are expressed in whole years. Do not record ages such as 7 1/2, 5 years and 2 mos., etc. Record the age according to the last birthday prior to May 1, 2000.

5. Check for inconsistencies in the ages of husband, wife and children. The respondent may have given incorrect information for one reason or another. Probe and verify further, as needed. An example is when the mother is only 15 years older than the eldest child.

6. If the exact age is not known, ask for an estimate. It may also help to ask an aged person to recall some well-known local, national or world event in the past by which his age may be associated, or if he is older or younger than some prominent persons. If all possible means have been exhausted and the respondent is unable to give the correct information, enter his best estimate.

7. There must be a report of age in P6 for every household member.
Age as of Last Birthday Conversion Table (see code book) will help you check the reported age of a person against his date of birth. Refer to this table when checking your entries on age for consistency.]]>

P7 Sex

Gender-disaggregated    data    is    of    prime    importance    in demographic and socio-economic studies. Separate data for males and females are important for the analysis of other types of data, and for the evaluation of the completeness and accuracy of the census counts of population.

Determine the sex of each household member by asking the question "Is male or female?"  
The sex of each household member can be determined by his/her name or relationship to the head, but in some cases there is a need to ask the respondent whether the person is male or female. Some names such as Charlie, Florence, Neneng, Alex, Chito, Cielito, Christy, Loreto, Trinidad, Dakila, Resurreccion, Rosario, Joey, Regine, Gene (Jean), etc., could be those of male or female persons.

Draw an "x" mark on the circle before MALE, if the member is a male. Otherwise, draw an "x" mark on the circle before FEMALE.]]>

P9 Marital status

Marital status refers to the personal status of each individual in reference to the marriage laws or customs of the country. It is the same as "civil status", the term usually used in official and private records, documents, transactions, etc., in the country. In Census 2000, the person's marital status shall be as of the date of visit.
For persons below 10 years old, draw an "x" mark on the circle before Single without asking the question. For persons 10 years old and over ask:

"What is ______'s marital status?" Cross out the circle before the appropriate marital status reported by the respondent as defined in the next page.


1. Single
A person who has never been married.

2. Legally Married
A person married in a religious or civil ceremony, either living together with spouse at the time of visit, or temporarily living apart because his spouse is employed elsewhere or is in the Armed Forces, etc.

3. Widowed
A married person whose spouse died and who has not remarried up to the time of visit.

4. Divorced/Separated
A person who is permanently separated from his spouse, legally or through mutual consent. Also for a person whose marriage with another has been annulled or dissolved and can therefore remarry.

5. Common-law/   
Live in person cohabiting or living consensually with another as husband and wife without the benefit of a legal marriage.

6. Unknown
Person whose marital status is not known to the respondent, or whose marital status is being concealed by the respondent.


A Word of Caution: Some respondents may find this question too personal or a sensitive issue. Avoid antagonizing the respondent. Do not refute the reported marital status of any person. Disregard any knowledge you may have about the person and record only whatever is reported by the respondent.]]>

P10 Religious Affiliation

Religious affiliation refers to a particular system of beliefs, attitudes, emotions and behaviors constituting man's relationship with the powers and principalities of the universe. Data on this are required for the planning of religion-related and religion-sponsored activities. They may also be used for an examination of ethnic characteristics of the population.

Enter the code for the religious affiliation of each person as reported by the respondent. Use the Code Book as reference.

If the reported religious affiliation is not among the pre-coded answers provided in the questionnaire, write code 99.

An infant who is not yet baptized must carry the religious affiliation of his mother.

Take note that the "Protestant" religion has different denominations, and so with "other" religions. In case you are in doubt on how to classify a certain religious sect, write the specific religion on the space provided.

There are Roman Catholics, Protestants, etc. who joined some charismatic movements or fellowships and now claim themselves as "born again" Christians or charismatics. In this case, verify where they are attending religious services.

Indigenous peoples (IP) who practice the traditional religion or belief system may not belong to any church, unless they have been converted to one. If the member of the household, who is an IP, is baptized in any of the formal religions, the mentioned formal religious affiliation will be coded. However, if the IP respondent mentioned that the member of the household has faith in Kabunian, Apo na Mallari, Magbabaya, and so on, which refer to supreme deities in their language, the religious affiliation shall be coded as 92 for Traditional Religion. Tribal Religion is characterized by the observance of indigenous rituals venerating the dead ancestors and invoking divine intercession for good things in life.

Before proceeding with the last five items on CPH Form 2, look at the following example on how to complete P1 to P10.

P11 and P12 Citizenship

Citizenship is defined as the legal nationality of a person. A citizen is a legal national of the country at the time of census, while an alien is a non-national of the country. The collection of data on citizenship permits the classification of the population into (a) citizens and (b) aliens.
Data on citizenship are valuable in the study of problems relating to the legal status and civil rights of immigrants.

A person's citizenship depends on the country to which he owes legal allegiance or where he exercises the right of suffrage.

Ask the question in P11: "Is ________ a citizen of the Philippines" for all persons. This question determines who among the members of the household are citizens of the Philippines and who are not. If the household member is a citizen of the Philippines, cross out circle for the category Yes and skip to P13. However, if the household member is not a citizen of the Philippines, mark the circle before NO in P11 and ask the question in P12: "What country is _______ a citizen of".

Enter the appropriate code for the country of citizenship of household members who are not Filipinos. The codes are listed in the Code Book.

For persons with dual citizenship, both aliens, inquire which one should be reported and enter the code for the preferred country of citizenship. However, for those with dual citizenship, Filipino and an alien citizenship, cross out the circle for Yes in P11.

For persons whose citizenship is other than those provided with codes at the bottom of the questionnaire, write on the space provided the name of the country to where they owe legal allegiance to.

If the person being interviewed hesitates to answer this question, remind him that the information will be held strictly confidential and no reference to individual persons will be made.]]>

P13 and P14 Disability

Disability refers to any restriction or lack of ability (resulting from an impairment) to perform an activity in the manner or within the range considered normal for a human being. Impairments associated with disabilities may be physical, mental, or sensory motor impairment such as partial or total blindness and deafness, muteness, speech defect, orthopedic handicaps, and mental retardation. Data on disability will enable planners to prepare plans for rehabilitation, education development and preventive programs.

To identify household members who may have disabilities. A "screening" question is asked in column P13. For each household member, ask the respondent "Does _____ have any physical or mental disability?" If the answer is Yes, draw an "x" mark on the circle before YES in 

P13 and ask the question in P14: "What type of disability does ____have?" If the answer in P13 is NO, draw an "x" mark on the circle before NO in P13 and skip to P15.

The specific types of disabilities and their respective codes are listed in the Code Book. Be sure to use this Code Book as your guide in probing for information and for coding the responses in column P14. If the answer of the respondent is other than the types of disability listed, write in the space provided the answer of the respondent. The descriptions of the disabilities are given below:

Code 01
No useful sight in any of the two eyes. (Cannot distinguish objects in front of him). Persons may have some light perception (e.g., can realize that it is midday or midnight), but do not have usable sight. They need Braille materials for reading.
Short name: Tot-Blind
 
Code 02
With better eyesight than totally blind: can distinguish objects in front of him. However, even with eyeglasses cannot distinguish large letters. Practically, this person can walk without hitting his head against the wall, but cannot read anything. Included here as persons with severely limiting vision situations: central only or the sides only or only like a pie of a cake. Persons who can see some objects so that they can walk better and do some activities, but they cannot read printed text even with eyeglasses. They need Braille materials for reading.
Short name: Part-Blind
 
Code 03
With the better eye, even with eyeglasses, cannot distinguish regular size letters. Practically, can only read the bigger headlines in the newspapers. Included here are persons with limiting vision situations: central only or the sides only or only like a pie of a cake. Persons who, even with appropriate eyeglasses, need large print text (i.e., at least 18 points font) to read at a distance of one foot (30 cm.)
Short name: Low vision

Code 04	
Cannot realize any regular sound. Practically the person does not react when somebody claps his hands behind his back. Person may still hear the blowing of a horn of a truck, or the beat of a drum, cannot understand words even with a hearing aid. Mute: There are almost no mute people. The normal case is the so-called "deaf-mute" which is for people who, because of deafness, did not learn to talk but they have all what is physically necessary to talk. Treat them as deaf.	
Short name: Tot-Deaf

Code 05	
Can hear speech but cannot discriminate the words. [Refers to a person whose both ears can recognize sounds but cannot determine the words (partially deaf).]	
Short name: Part- Deaf

Code 06	
Person can understand words only if spoken very loud or close to the ear and (normally) has severe difficulties if there are other noises (e.g.,) of other people speaking in the room. Person can be helped with a hearing aid but still has difficulties understanding normal speech.
Short name: Hard-Hear

Code 07	
Person at least 15 years old, is object of ridicule or has severely limited job opportunities because of either: - a general stammering problem which makes normal speech extremely difficult - or a cleft-palate or hare-lip that cannot be solved by current medical procedures.	
Short name: Oral defect

Code 08	
Person has only one useful hand. One arm is not usable (e.g., amputated, deformed or paralyzed arm). Included here are two artificial arms if they are rather useful (i.e., both arms are missing but are replaced with artificial arm).	
Short name: One hand

Code 09	
Person has no useful hands. Both arms are not usable (e.g., amputated, deformed and missing).
Short name: No hands

Code 10	
Person has only one useful leg: walks with crutches and/or artificial leg and/or braces. Note (1) Walking with an artificial leg can be considered if it really prevents the person from holding most jobs. (2) If the person has two legs amputated but in such a way that artificial legs can be used, the person can still go to most places, including going up the stairs. It may be slower, but it is surely very different from a person in a wheelchair who cannot even climb a single step without help.	
Short name: One leg

Code 11	
Person has no useful legs or two legs unusable (e.g., normally sits in a wheelchair.)	
Short name: No legs

Code 12	
Regular/Mild cerebral palsy: person can still walk and do most activities or might only be slightly awkward and require no special assistance.	
Short name: Cr-Quadrip

The term cerebral refers to the brain's two halves, or hemispheres, and palsy describes any disorder that impairs control of body movement. Thus, these disorders are not caused by problems in the muscles or nerves. Instead, faulty development or damage to motor areas in the brain disrupts the brain's ability to adequately control movement and posture. An individual with cerebral palsy may have difficulty with fine motor tasks, such as writing or cutting with scissors; experience trouble with maintaining balance and walking; or be affected by involuntary movements, such as uncontrollable writhing motion of the hands or drooling.

Code13	
Severe cerebral palsy: person is severely affected by the cerebral palsy or might be unable to walk and need extensive, lifelong care.	
Short name: Cs-Quadrip

Code14	
Regularly intellectually impaired: can be trained to be toilet trained, to wash himself, eat on his own and follow single instructions. Included here are those with Down Syndrome (Mongoloids) and most autistic (persons with autism). Note, not included are slow learners and persons who can travel alone.	
Short name: Ir-Retarded

Code15	
Severely intellectually impaired: cannot be toilet trained, eat alone, severe autism, etc.	
Short name: Is-Retarded

Code16	
Regularly impaired by mental illness: actually under psychiatric care or should be under psychiatric care (but do not have the money) as well as patients who recovered within the last three years (to consider the problem that so many becomes sick again). Included here are most persons with epilepsy even if the origin of their problem is very different, people treat them a bit the same as the mentally ill, they have more difficulties obtaining jobs, etc.	
Short name: Pr-Mentally ill

Code17	
Severely impaired by mental illness: persons needing hospitalization or having been hospitalized within the last three years (as mentioned above, to consider the fact that so many become sick again).
Short name: Ps-Mentally ill

Code18	
Regularly multiple impaired. Multiple impairment is always a severe disability, yet among those with multiple impairment, one can be much lighter than the others whom we call severely multiple handicapped. Examples, are one arm and one leg unusable, mentally retarded and some physical defect.	
Short name: Mr-Impairment

Code19
 Severely multiple impaired. Examples are both legs and both arms paralyzed (quadriplegic); deaf and blind, and severely cerebral palsied and blind.

P13 and P14 Disability

Disability refers to any restriction or lack of ability (resulting from an impairment) to perform an activity in the manner or within the range considered normal for a human being. Impairments associated with disabilities may be physical, mental, or sensory motor impairment such as partial or total blindness and deafness, muteness, speech defect, orthopedic handicaps, and mental retardation. Data on disability will enable planners to prepare plans for rehabilitation, education development and preventive programs.

To identify household members who may have disabilities. A "screening" question is asked in column P13. For each household member, ask the respondent "Does _____ have any physical or mental disability?" If the answer is Yes, draw an "x" mark on the circle before YES in 

P13 and ask the question in P14: "What type of disability does ____have?" If the answer in P13 is NO, draw an "x" mark on the circle before NO in P13 and skip to P15.

The specific types of disabilities and their respective codes are listed in the Code Book. Be sure to use this Code Book as your guide in probing for information and for coding the responses in column P14. If the answer of the respondent is other than the types of disability listed, write in the space provided the answer of the respondent. The descriptions of the disabilities are given below:

Code 01
No useful sight in any of the two eyes. (Cannot distinguish objects in front of him). Persons may have some light perception (e.g., can realize that it is midday or midnight), but do not have usable sight. They need Braille materials for reading.
Short name: Tot-Blind
 
Code 02
With better eyesight than totally blind: can distinguish objects in front of him. However, even with eyeglasses cannot distinguish large letters. Practically, this person can walk without hitting his head against the wall, but cannot read anything. Included here as persons with severely limiting vision situations: central only or the sides only or only like a pie of a cake. Persons who can see some objects so that they can walk better and do some activities, but they cannot read printed text even with eyeglasses. They need Braille materials for reading.
Short name: Part-Blind
 
Code 03
With the better eye, even with eyeglasses, cannot distinguish regular size letters. Practically, can only read the bigger headlines in the newspapers. Included here are persons with limiting vision situations: central only or the sides only or only like a pie of a cake. Persons who, even with appropriate eyeglasses, need large print text (i.e., at least 18 points font) to read at a distance of one foot (30 cm.)
Short name: Low vision

Code 04	
Cannot realize any regular sound. Practically the person does not react when somebody claps his hands behind his back. Person may still hear the blowing of a horn of a truck, or the beat of a drum, cannot understand words even with a hearing aid. Mute: There are almost no mute people. The normal case is the so-called "deaf-mute" which is for people who, because of deafness, did not learn to talk but they have all what is physically necessary to talk. Treat them as deaf.	
Short name: Tot-Deaf

Code 05	
Can hear speech but cannot discriminate the words. [Refers to a person whose both ears can recognize sounds but cannot determine the words (partially deaf).]	
Short name: Part- Deaf

Code 06	
Person can understand words only if spoken very loud or close to the ear and (normally) has severe difficulties if there are other noises (e.g.,) of other people speaking in the room. Person can be helped with a hearing aid but still has difficulties understanding normal speech.
Short name: Hard-Hear

Code 07	
Person at least 15 years old, is object of ridicule or has severely limited job opportunities because of either: - a general stammering problem which makes normal speech extremely difficult - or a cleft-palate or hare-lip that cannot be solved by current medical procedures.	
Short name: Oral defect

Code 08	
Person has only one useful hand. One arm is not usable (e.g., amputated, deformed or paralyzed arm). Included here are two artificial arms if they are rather useful (i.e., both arms are missing but are replaced with artificial arm).	
Short name: One hand

Code 09	
Person has no useful hands. Both arms are not usable (e.g., amputated, deformed and missing).
Short name: No hands

Code 10	
Person has only one useful leg: walks with crutches and/or artificial leg and/or braces. Note (1) Walking with an artificial leg can be considered if it really prevents the person from holding most jobs. (2) If the person has two legs amputated but in such a way that artificial legs can be used, the person can still go to most places, including going up the stairs. It may be slower, but it is surely very different from a person in a wheelchair who cannot even climb a single step without help.	
Short name: One leg

Code 11	
Person has no useful legs or two legs unusable (e.g., normally sits in a wheelchair.)	
Short name: No legs

P15 Ethnicity

Ethnicity is a primary sense of belonging to an ethnolinguistic group; it is consanguineal in nature, meaning, the ties are reckoned by blood and traced through the family tree. Thus, the item refers to the members of the household's identity of self-ascription, as one belonging to a group, by blood.

Ethno-linguistic grouping denotes genealogical and paternal lineage to any of the Philippine group of native population. This group has continuously lived as organized community on communally bounded and defined territory, and who have, under claims of ownership since time immemorial, occupied, possessed and utilized such territories, sharing common bonds of language, customs, traditions and other distinctive cultural traits (and) shall likewise include peoples who are regarded as indigenous on account of their descent	". This also includes those who have been displaced or from their traditional domains or who may have resettled outside their domains.

Cases of mixed ancestry, that is, parents belonging to different ethnic groups may occur. The family being bilateral just like any Filipino family, respondents have a choice whether or not to indicate the paternal or maternal branch as the reference point of their ethnic classification. The children of mixed marriages may follow the ethnic affiliation of a parent with whom he/she has more association. However, for children who do not talk vet at the time of census, their ethnicity would be that of the mother.

Ask the respondent the question in P15: "How does	________'s classify himself/herself? 
Is he/she an Ibaloi, Kankanaey, Mangyan, Manobo, Chinese, llocano or what?" for all members of the household. The ethnicity and their corresponding codes for this item are listed in the Code Book. If it is not among the pre-coded answers, write the ethnicity on the space provided but not touching the code boxes.

Note: Items P22 and P23 are to be accomplished only for household members who are at least five years old. If a household member is younger than five years of age, leave columns P22 and P23 blank.]]>

P16 Literacy

Data on literacy provide an important indication of the capability of the nation for economic,   social and cultural development. Such data serve as guide to planners concerned with the policies for the development of the educational system.
 
Simple literacy is the ability to read and write a simple message. A person is literate when he can both read and write a simple message in any language or dialect. A person who cannot both read and write a simple message, like "Census 2000 count me in" is illiterate. Also consider a person illiterate if he is capable of reading and writing only his own name or numbers, as well as a person who can read but not write, or vice versa.

A person who knows how to read and write but at the time of the census he/she can no longer read and/or write due to some physical defects or illness is considered literate. Example of this is an aged person who knows how to read and write but can no longer perform these activities due to poor eyesight.

Disabled persons who can read and write through any means such as Braille are considered literate.

Ask the question in P16: "Can ______ read and write a simple message in any language or dialect?" Enter "x" mark in the circle before YES, for those persons who are literate, or cross out the circle for NO, for those persons who are illiterate.]]>

P19 School attendance

Data on school attendance provide a description of the school-age population actually in school. The proportion of the school-age population, which is able to take advantage of the educational system, is necessary in the assessment of the adequacy of the educational system of the country.
Ask the respondent the question in P19: "Did _______ attend school at any time from June 1999 to March 2000?" for all persons 5 years old and over. If the answer is Yes, cross out the circle for this category; otherwise, place an "x" in the circle for No.

School attendance means attendance at any educational institution, public or private, for formal academic education at the elementary, high school, college or university level at any time during the school year June 1999 to March 2000.

Attendance in these schools leads to a higher grade and ultimately, to an academic title/degree. It includes attendance in night classes.

Include school attendance that is leading to a high school diploma in vocational high schools such as schools of arts and trades or technical high schools, and rural or agricultural high schools. Also include attendance in post secondary vocational/technical schools which are within the regular system of education such as universities and colleges.

Examples:

a. Eulogio "Amang" Rodriguez Institute of Science and Technology (EARIST)
b. San Carlos Rural High School

Exclude, however, attendance in vocational schools outside the regular system of education, in such short courses as dressmaking, beauty culture, hair science, auto mechanic, motor vehicle driving, typing, stenography, bookkeeping, etc. Also exclude day care centers which teach children the alphabet just to pass away their time.

Examples:

a. A-l Driving School
b. CWL Vocational Center
c. Twinkle Twinkle Little Star Day Care Center

Also exclude training received by mail from correspondence schools like ICS (International Correspondence School). However, if the correspondence courses are given by a regular school such as a university, and they are considered toward promotion in the regular school system, such schooling should be included. Also exclude school attendance in review classes for bar or board or other examination for the practice of a profession or trade.

If a person was enrolled at the beginning of the school year or on the second semester but subsequently dropped out from school, draw an "x" mark on the circle corresponding the answer YES.

If an answer of Yes is given for a person who is old enough to have graduated from college (25 years old and over), verify the answer, especially in barangays far from colleges and universities, before drawing an "x" mark on the circle corresponding the answer YES.

P21 Type of school

For all persons 5 years old and over, whose answer in P19 is Yes and there is an entry in P20, ask the respondent the question in P21: "What type of school?". Cross out the circle corresponding to the selected category. If the answer is for "Government/Public" or "Private", proceed to ask the question in P21, otherwise, skip to P23.

Public schools are those schools entirely subsidized by the national government as mandated by the Constitution. Free government elementary and secondary schools have been established in many barangays throughout the country. Preschool education, however, are mostly offered by private sector. Public colleges and universities are classified into three categories, as follows:

1. Chartered state universities  and  colleges  are  institutions that enjoy autonomy  under a  self-governing  board  of regents  chaired  by the Secretary of the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) or by his or her designated representative.

2. Non-chartered state colleges are higher educational institutions offering higher education courses. Many of them evolved from technical schools such as schools of arts and trades (SATs), agriculture, and others.

3. Community colleges are mostly outgrowths of barangay high schools located in rural areas and offer degree programs including graduate programs.

Private schools are those schools subsidized by a private person or a group of persons. Some of the secondary and post secondary schools are private stock (non-sectarian) or non-corporations. Private colleges and universities are governed by corporation laws. Such institutions have their respective board of directors or trustees and are either stock or non-stock corporations. Institutions with religious affiliations are classified as sectarian schools and are non-stock organizations.

Madrasah and others refer to schools that provide alternative learning system. This alternative learning system is classified as non-formal and informal educational systems. However, such entities are not accredited by the Department of Education, Culture and Sports. Learning systems like schools of living traditions which are organized by indigenous communities and supported by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts are categorized as "others".]]>

P22 Highest educational attainment

Data on highest educational attainment furnish material for a comparison of the present educational equipment of the adult population with the present and anticipated future requirements of manpower for various types of economic activities.

Highest educational attainment refers to the highest grade or year completed in school, college or university as of May 1, 2000. This may be any one of the specific grades or years in elementary, high school, post secondary school, college and post-baccalaureate levels of schooling. It also includes pre-school education.

Ask the question in P22: "What is the highest grade/year completed by ___?" for all persons 5 years old and over. Enter in P22 the two-digit code corresponding to the highest educational attainment, which are listed in the Code Book.

If the answer given by the respondent is in terms of the level of schooling only (e.g., elementary, high school, college) and not the specific grade or year completed, determine the specific grade or year by asking the respondent additional questions. The answer "Elementary" or "High School" is insufficient.

Examples:


1. Enter 11 if the person has only completed Grade 1, 13 for Grade 3 or 22 for 2nd Year High School.
2. If the person has not completed any grade at all, enter 00.
3. The code for pre-school is 01.
4. A student who is enrolled in 2nd year high school at the time of the census has completed 1st year and should therefore be reported as 1st year high school - 21.


Report also in P22 the post secondary course that a person has completed. Post secondary course refers to the stage of formal education following the secondary education level covering non-degree programs that have varying duration lasting up to three years, concerned primarily with developing strong and appropriately trained middle level manpower.

Post Secondary 1 year is the highest grade completed by a person who has taken a post secondary course for at least a year but has not yet completed the course at the time of Census 2000. Consider, for example, a person who at the time of the census is a 2nd year student of a 2-year course in Automotive Technology. Since he has finished his 1st year in Automotive Technology, he is considered under this category and the correct code is 31.
Post Secondary 2 years is the highest grade completed by a person who has taken at least two year but has not yet completed the course at the time of Census 2000. The appropriate code for this is 32.

In order to determine whether the vocational/technical course reported by the respondent is under post secondary education (formal education) the following probing questions should be asked:

1. Is the course offered/taken in school, college/university or NMYC? If in
NMYC, the course is non-formal and therefore, will not be considered as post secondary education. 

If in school, college/university the following question should be asked:

2. Is completion of high school course a requirement for admission?   If yes, the course is considered formal, hence, post secondary.

If the person has successfully completed his post secondary education, enter the code of the course/certificate completed in the code boxes and specify its title and corresponding duration on the space provided. The codes (50 - 58) are provided in the Code Book.

Examples:


2-Yr. Associate in Art, code 50
2-Yr. Certificate in Physical Education, code 51
6-Mo. Basic Computer System, code 54
6-Mo. Auto Diesel Technology, code 56


Take note of the following cases:

1. If a person finished a post secondary course and is currently a 1st year college student, his post secondary course should be reported.

2. If a person is currently enrolled in a (6-month or 1-year) post secondary course but has not finished the course, he should be reported as a high school graduate.

3. If a person is currently in 1st year college or post secondary, do not assume that he is only a high school graduate. Verify if he has taken/completed other courses   (degree or non-degree courses).

If the person is a college undergraduate, i.e., he has not earned a degree; enter the code for the year of his completed education as 41 for 1st year college, 44 for 4th year college, etc. 

Note that code 46 stands for 6th or higher year in college. If he has graduated from college but has never been enrolled in any post-baccalaureate course, the appropriate code may either be 60 to 68, depending on the college course finished. Different categories are listed in the Code Book.

Usually, it is difficult to differentiate certificate and diploma courses that are under post secondary education from post-graduate courses. In order to determine whether the course reported by the respondent is a post secondary or post-graduate course, the following question should be asked:

Is a baccalaureate or a college degree a requirement for admission to certificate or diploma course? If yes, the course is considered under postgraduate course. Otherwise, it is classified as post secondary course.

Examples:


Certificate in Development Economics - post graduate course
Diploma in Population Communication - post graduate course
Diploma in Junior Secretarial	- post secondary
Certificate in Agri-Business	- post secondary


The acquisition of a college degree implies the successful completion of a course study. Information on degree received should be collected only for persons who have completed a course study at the third level of education. Such information should include the title of the highest degree received, and an indication of the field of study if the title does not make it clear.
For a college graduate, enter the corresponding code of the specific Bachelor's or higher degree obtained. The codes (60 - 68) are provided in the Code Book.

Examples:		

B.S. Commerce, code 63
B.S. Chemical Engineering, code 65
B.S. Math, code 64

For those who have pursued and completed two or more degrees of the same level and duration, report only one degree or whichever degree the person preferred to be reported.

Post-baccalaureate refers to any course for which an under graduate degree is required. Masters and doctoral degree students and graduates fall under this category. In addition, law or medical students who have earned a degree, e.g., BS Political Science, BS Zoology, BS Med. Tech., etc. but are still in law or medical school should also be considered under this category. The appropriate code for this educational level is 71. The same rule applies to graduate students who are still working for their master's degree, taking doctorate studies and for a person who have completed masters or doctoral degree. For both cases enter 71.

If an unusually high "highest educational attainment" is reported in relation to the age of the person, verify the report from the respondent. For example: 3rd year high school for a boy who is 13 years old or college graduate for a person who is 17 years old.]]>

P23 Residence 5 years ago

The question on residence 5 years ago pertains to the place where a person was residing 5 years ago. Data on these are vital for projects concerning housing and industrial development. 

Estimates of migration are needed for preparing population projections necessary for planning and policy purposes. Distribution of internal migration at certain geographic level will be better judged as to its implications to social changes given a detailed analysis of the volume and trend of internal migration.

Ask the question in P23: "In what city/municipality did ______ reside on May 1, 1995?" Enter code 0008 in P23 if the person's residence 5 years ago is the same as his present residence.
However, if his residence 5 years ago was in another city/municipality, write the name of the city/municipality and province on the space provided.

For those whose residence 5 years ago is in a foreign country, enter code 0007 in the code box.
If the respondent does not know the residence of the members of the household 5 years ago, ask the person himself about his residence 5 years ago. However, if the person cannot recall the name of the city/municipality and province where he lived 5 years ago after exhaustive probing, enter code 0009 for unknown in the code box.

Complete names of provinces should be written when provinces like llocos, Negros, Davao and Bicol were provided. Ask the respondent whether, he/she means llocos Norte or llocos Sur, Negros Oriental or Occidental, Davao del Sur, Davao del Norte or Davao Oriental and what particular province in the Bicol Region.

In cases where the respondent knows only the province but not the municipality, enter the correct code of the province in the first two code boxes and code 99 for the last two boxes.
Filling Up Questions P13 to P15, P22 and P23

Example:

To complete the example given earlier about the Santiago household, look at the following information and the corresponding items in CPH Form 2 as shown in Illustration 7.2.
Ismael is an architecture graduate, while his wife, Rodora is a nursing graduate. Karmela is a secretarial graduate while her husband Jose, who is a contract worker in Saudi Arabia, is an electronics engineering graduate. Their son, Carlito is only in Grade 1. Marissa, on the other hand, quit schooling after she lost her hearing in a car accident. She was then in the middle of her 3rd year in college. Their helper Alma Cruz has not completed any grade at all but can read and write.]]>

P24 Residence 10 years ago

The question on residence 10 years ago pertains to the place where a person was residing 10 years ago. Data on this are collected to fill the missing information on migration between 1990 and 1995.

Ask the question in P24: "In what city/municipality did ______ reside on May 1, 1990?". Enter code 0008 in P24 if the person's residence 10 years ago is the same as his present residence. However, if his residence 10 years ago was in another city/municipality, write the name of the city/municipality and province on the space provided.

For those whose residence 10 years ago was in a foreign country, enter code 0007 in the code box.

If the respondent does not know the residence of the members of the household 10 years ago, ask the person himself about his residence 10 years ago. However, if the person cannot recall the name of the city/municipality and province where he lived 10 years ago after exhaustive probing, enter code 0009 for unknown in the code box.

Complete names of provinces should be written when provinces like llocos, Negros, Davao and Bicol were provided. Ask the respondents whether, they mean llocos Norte or llocos Sur, Negros Oriental or Occidental, Davao del Sur, Davao del Norte or Davao Oriental and what particular province in the Bicol Region.

In cases where the respondent knows only the province where the member resided ten years ago, enter appropriate code of the province in the first two code boxes and code 99 for the last two boxes.

P24 Residence 10 years ago

The question on residence 10 years ago pertains to the place where a person was residing 10 years ago. Data on this are collected to fill the missing information on migration between 1990 and 1995.

Ask the question in P24: "In what city/municipality did ______ reside on May 1, 1990?". Enter code 0008 in P24 if the person's residence 10 years ago is the same as his present residence. However, if his residence 10 years ago was in another city/municipality, write the name of the city/municipality and province on the space provided.

For those whose residence 10 years ago was in a foreign country, enter code 0007 in the code box.

If the respondent does not know the residence of the members of the household 10 years ago, ask the person himself about his residence 10 years ago. However, if the person cannot recall the name of the city/municipality and province where he lived 10 years ago after exhaustive probing, enter code 0009 for unknown in the code box.

Complete names of provinces should be written when provinces like llocos, Negros, Davao and Bicol were provided. Ask the respondents whether, they mean llocos Norte or llocos Sur, Negros Oriental or Occidental, Davao del Sur, Davao del Norte or Davao Oriental and what particular province in the Bicol Region.

In cases where the respondent knows only the province where the member resided ten years ago, enter appropriate code of the province in the first two code boxes and code 99 for the last two boxes.

P25 Usual activity/occupation

Data on occupation are essential for analyzing the growth, composition and distribution of the work force. They provide information on socio-economic status of the population which is essential in planning the necessary training programs aimed at full and effective utilization of the country's human resources.

Ask the question in P25: "What was	______'s usual activity/occupation during the past twelve months?" for all persons 10 years old and over. Write in the space provided the type of activity/occupation of the person. This will be coded later using the Code Book.

Through this question we can determine whether a person is a gainful worker or is a non-gainful worker.

The term usual activity/occupation refers to the kind of job or business which a person was engaged in most of the time during the last twelve months preceding the interview. In other words, usual activity/occupation is the person's principal means of earning a living like a palay farmer, carpenter, retail merchant, elementary school teacher, telephone operator, etc. during the past twelve months.

For persons who did not work during the past 12 months, their usual activity/occupation relates to the non-gainful activities they usually do most of the year or to their status. They will be reported in either of the following:


1. Housekeeper, own home
2. Student
3. Pensioner (quite old to work and receiving monthly pension or annuity. Report under "Disabled" if disabled but still young).
4. Retired (quite old to work and not receiving monthly pension or annuity, including those retired from the government service or private employment who can still work but do not care to work anymore).
5. Disabled (suffering from permanent illness or permanent disability)
6. Dependent (other than above), etc.


For purposes of this census, a person is considered as gainful worker or usually working most of the time during the past 12 months if he works for at least 10 hours a week for 6 months (26 weeks) or longer, including vacation or sick leave, in one or more of these classes of work:


1. work for pay (wage, salary, commission, tips, etc.);
2. work for profit in own farm, business, private practice of a profession or trade, and;
3. work without pay on own family farm or business.


For persons whose activities varied during the preceding 12 months, report as his usual activity/occupation that which he was engaged in for more than six months. However, if none of these activities lasted for more than six months, report the one which had the longest duration.
For persons working at two permanent jobs, the job at which they work longer hours should be reported. If they spend the same number of hours on both jobs, report the job from which they earn greater income.

Take note of the following cases:

1. If a person worked most of the time during the past 12 months but  actually  devoted   more  time  to  studying  or housekeeping most of the year, report the gainful occupation he did and not student or housekeeper.

2. If for several years a person had been a school teacher but on May 1,
2000 has already quit his teaching job and is operating a palay farm, his usual occupation is still an elementary school teacher.

3. During the census, a person may be working in a job other than his usual occupation. For instance, an elementary school teacher works during the long school vacation as a merchant or a palay farmer or fisherman works temporarily as a carpenter. In these cases, the report should be "Elementary school teacher", "palay farmer", or "fisherman", respectively, and not the temporary jobs they are presently doing.

Always describe the specific job or occupation performed by the person in the establishment, office, farm, etc., such as radio technician, records clerk, typist, stenographer, lawyer, farm manager, elementary school teacher, bill collector, carpenter, hospital attendant, etc.
Answers such as agent, engineer, mechanic, employee, etc., do not describe adequately the work performed. Ask the respondent additional questions like "Does this person work for a life insurance company, advertising agency, etc.?" or "What kind of engineer/mechanic is he?"
If the respondent gives a long description of the actual duties of work of the person, report the occupation that fits the description.

Avoid such ambiguous descriptions as owner, partner, businessman, etc. They do not adequately describe the occupation of the person. They simply indicate the proprietary relationship of the person to the business and some owners do not do any work in connection with their business.

If a person is the owner of an enterprise and he manages it or participates in its management, report "Manager" as his occupation. However, in such enterprises emerge in wholesale or retail trade, hotel, dormitory, restaurant, cafeteria or other lodging or eating place, said owner managing or participating in the management of the enterprise should be reported as "wholesale merchant", "retailer", or "working proprietor ". Note however, that a partner in a business who is paid by the partnership to manage the business should be reported as "manager" and not "working proprietor".]]>

P25 Usual activity/occupation

Data on occupation are essential for analyzing the growth, composition and distribution of the work force. They provide information on socio-economic status of the population which is essential in planning the necessary training programs aimed at full and effective utilization of the country's human resources.

Ask the question in P25: "What was	______'s usual activity/occupation during the past twelve months?" for all persons 10 years old and over. Write in the space provided the type of activity/occupation of the person. This will be coded later using the Code Book.

Through this question we can determine whether a person is a gainful worker or is a non-gainful worker.

The term usual activity/occupation refers to the kind of job or business which a person was engaged in most of the time during the last twelve months preceding the interview. In other words, usual activity/occupation is the person's principal means of earning a living like a palay farmer, carpenter, retail merchant, elementary school teacher, telephone operator, etc. during the past twelve months.

For persons who did not work during the past 12 months, their usual activity/occupation relates to the non-gainful activities they usually do most of the year or to their status. They will be reported in either of the following:


1. Housekeeper, own home
2. Student
3. Pensioner (quite old to work and receiving monthly pension or annuity. Report under "Disabled" if disabled but still young).
4. Retired (quite old to work and not receiving monthly pension or annuity, including those retired from the government service or private employment who can still work but do not care to work anymore).
5. Disabled (suffering from permanent illness or permanent disability)
6. Dependent (other than above), etc.


For purposes of this census, a person is considered as gainful worker or usually working most of the time during the past 12 months if he works for at least 10 hours a week for 6 months (26 weeks) or longer, including vacation or sick leave, in one or more of these classes of work:


1. work for pay (wage, salary, commission, tips, etc.);
2. work for profit in own farm, business, private practice of a profession or trade, and;
3. work without pay on own family farm or business.


For persons whose activities varied during the preceding 12 months, report as his usual activity/occupation that which he was engaged in for more than six months. However, if none of these activities lasted for more than six months, report the one which had the longest duration.
For persons working at two permanent jobs, the job at which they work longer hours should be reported. If they spend the same number of hours on both jobs, report the job from which they earn greater income.

Take note of the following cases:

1. If a person worked most of the time during the past 12 months but  actually  devoted   more  time  to  studying  or housekeeping most of the year, report the gainful occupation he did and not student or housekeeper.

2. If for several years a person had been a school teacher but on May 1,
2000 has already quit his teaching job and is operating a palay farm, his usual occupation is still an elementary school teacher.

3. During the census, a person may be working in a job other than his usual occupation. For instance, an elementary school teacher works during the long school vacation as a merchant or a palay farmer or fisherman works temporarily as a carpenter. In these cases, the report should be "Elementary school teacher", "palay farmer", or "fisherman", respectively, and not the temporary jobs they are presently doing.

Always describe the specific job or occupation performed by the person in the establishment, office, farm, etc., such as radio technician, records clerk, typist, stenographer, lawyer, farm manager, elementary school teacher, bill collector, carpenter, hospital attendant, etc.
Answers such as agent, engineer, mechanic, employee, etc., do not describe adequately the work performed. Ask the respondent additional questions like "Does this person work for a life insurance company, advertising agency, etc.?" or "What kind of engineer/mechanic is he?"
If the respondent gives a long description of the actual duties of work of the person, report the occupation that fits the description.

Avoid such ambiguous descriptions as owner, partner, businessman, etc. They do not adequately describe the occupation of the person. They simply indicate the proprietary relationship of the person to the business and some owners do not do any work in connection with their business.

If a person is the owner of an enterprise and he manages it or participates in its management, report "Manager" as his occupation. However, in such enterprises emerge in wholesale or retail trade, hotel, dormitory, restaurant, cafeteria or other lodging or eating place, said owner managing or participating in the management of the enterprise should be reported as "wholesale merchant", "retailer", or "working proprietor ".

P26 Kind of business or industry
 
Industry refers to the nature or character of the business or enterprise or the place wherein the person works. Data on this provide information on the level and trend of industrialization and on important aspects of the country's potential for economic development.
 
For persons 10 years old and over with report of gainful usual activity/occupation in P25, ask the question in P26: "In what kind of business or industry did	work during the past twelve months?" However, for persons 10 years old and over who are non-gainful workers (housewife, students, retiree, disabled, etc.) and for those below 10 years old, leave P26 blank.

The entries in this column and in P25 should be consistent with each other. The business or industry should describe specifically and adequately the character and nature of business or industry or the place where the work is being performed in connection with the job or occupation, such as palay farm, sari-sari store, gold mine, leather shoe factory, rice mill, etc. Do not be satisfied with answers like firm names such as Soriano and Co., LM Enterprise, etc., since they do not necessarily describe the business or activity. Probe and try to elicit from the respondent information about the kind of product (if manufacturing firm) or the kind of service that the company is engaged in.

Moreover, if work is pursued in a big company that is engaged in several types of activities, report the nature of the particular activity of that company in which the person is working.
If work is for government office or institution, the name of the office, bureau, public school, etc. may be accepted. If work is for the executive branch of a local government, indicate whether provincial, city or municipal government.

Moreover, when the government office engages in services other than administrative such as education, communication, health, transportation, construction, etc., persons working in such office must be reported in their corresponding activity, such as railroad, airport, insurance, high school, highway construction, etc.

Below are examples of how some officials and employees of the government should be reported:

Usual occupation: Accounting clerk	
Business or industry: Central bank

Usual occupation: Registered nurse	
Business or industry: Puericulture center

Usual occupation: Market collector	
Business or industry: Municipal government

Usual occupation: Bill collector	
Business or industry: Waterworks (MWSS)

Usual occupation: Bulldozer operator	
Business or industry: Road construction (DPWH)

Usual occupation: Stenographer	
Business or industry: Provincial government

Distinction should be made between manufacturing and retailing in cases where an establishment engages in both activities. The entry in this column should be according to the part of the establishment in which the person works. Likewise, manufacturing should be differentiated from wholesaling.

Example:
 
A traveling salesman working for a distributor of soft drinks will have an entry of "soft drink distribution" for industry. A traveling salesman for a soft drink factory itself will have "soft drink factory" for industry.

You must distinguish between two kinds of business specializing in selling. A wholesale store sells primarily to retailers, while a retail store sells directly to consumers.

For a person conducting his business in his own house, report his business just as you are reporting a regular establishment, such as dressmaking or tailoring shop, radio repair shop, law office, dental clinic, etc.

If a person does not have a permanent job and usually pursues his usual occupation by working for several employers engaged in different kinds of business or industry like many farm and manual laborers, report the kind of business or industry in which he usually works longest during the past 12 months.

P28 Class of worker

The question P28 is to be asked for those who were engaged in an economic activity in the past 12 months:  "For whom or where does/did _______ work?"

The response to this question should refer to the usual occupation recorded in P25.

Possible responses are categorized into seven (7) classes of workers:

1. Worked for private household (Domestic Services). If a person worked in a private household for pay, in cash or in kind. Examples are family drivers, gardener, yaya, household help and other persons in domestic service.

2. Worked for private business/enterprise/farm. All employees in private firms and farms are classified here.

Other examples of this class of workers are:


Persons working in public works project on private contracts
Public transport drivers who do not own the vehicle but drive them on boundary basis
Dock hands or stevedores 
Cargo handlers in public market, railroad stations or piers, etc.
Palay harvester getting fixed share of harvested palay, sacadas and other farm workers.


3. Worked for government/government corporations. All government employees would be classified here. Examples of this class of workers are:


Employees in national and local government offices, agencies and corporation
Filipinos working in embassies, legation, chancelleries or consulates of foreign government in the Philippines
Filipinos working in international organizations of Sovereign States of Government like the United Nations, World Health Organization, etc.
Chaplains in the Armed Forces of the Philippines.


4. Self-employed without any paid employee. If a person worked for profit or fees in own business, farm, profession or trade without any paid employee. Examples include vendors, professionals with own offices/clinics, workers who worked purely on commission basis and who have no regular working hours.

5. Employer in own farm or business.  If a person, working in his own business, farm, profession or trade had one or more regular paid employees, including paid family members (code 6 below). Some cases worth noting:

Domestic helpers, family drivers and other household helpers who assist in the family operated business, regardless of time spent in this activity, are NOT hired employees in the enterprise/business; hence a farm or business proprietor who is assisted purely by such domestic help is not considered an employer.

A retail store operator who is wholly assisted in the operation of his/her store by unpaid relatives living with him/her and who employs carpenters to construct a building for his store (with store operator supervising the work) is not an employer. However, if this operator is also the owner or partner of a firm with paid construction workers and staff, and the reported industry in P26 is building construction, then he is an employer.

6. Worked with pay on own family-operated farm or business.
If a person worked in own family-operated farm or business and receives cash or a fixed share of the produce as payment for his services. Note that whenever there is a household member with this code, there should be a household member with code 5 for class of worker.

7. Worked without pay on own family-operated farm or business. If a member of the family worked without pay in a farm or business operated by another member living in the same household.]]>

        <![CDATA[EDATTAIN records the person's educational attainment in terms of the level of schooling completed (degree or other milestone). The emphasis on level completed is critical: a person attending the final year of secondary education receives the code for having completed lower secondary only -- and in some samples only primary. 

EDATTAIN does not necessarily reflect any particular country's definition of the various levels of schooling in terms of terminology or the number of years of schooling.  EDATTAIN is an attempt to merge -- into a single, roughly comparable variable -- samples that provide degrees, ones that provide actual years of schooling, and those that have some of both. In addition to EDATTAIN, a country-specific education classification is provided which loses no information and reflects the particular educational system of that country (for example EDUCBR for Brazil, EDUCCL for Chile, and EDUCUS for the United States).  As always, users can refer to the original education source variables for each sample, if they wish.

Many samples also give single years of schooling completed, recorded in YRSCHOOL.   Some samples provide educational information in a form that could not be incorporated into EDATTAIN.]]>

The emphasis on level completed is critical: a person attending the final year of secondary education receives the code for having completed lower secondary only -- and in some samples only primary. 

EDATTAIN does not necessarily reflect any particular country's definition of the various levels of schooling in terms of terminology or the number of years of schooling.  EDATTAIN is an attempt to merge -- into a single, roughly comparable variable -- samples that provide degrees, ones that provide actual years of schooling, and those that have some of both. In addition to EDATTAIN, a country-specific education classification is provided which loses no information and reflects the particular educational system of that country (for example EDUCBR for Brazil, EDUCCL for Chile, and EDUCUS for the United States).  As always, users can refer to the original education source variables for each sample, if they wish.

Many samples also give single years of schooling completed, recorded in YRSCHOOL.   Some samples provide educational information in a form that could not be incorporated into EDATTAIN.]]>
